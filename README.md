THU-SPHSOL is developed for hypervelocity impact simulations in astrodynamics and planetary science, based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method.

Details are documented in our recent article at https://doi.org/10.1360/SST-2022-0274.

The code is freely available for academic uses, upon request by email to the authors. (And it will be open-source soon!)
